This directory contains samples of bad binaries to try and help me debug
the "bad binary" problem, which is that sometimes the compiler outputs
a binary that behaves incorrectly, and then when recompiled the exact
same source code produces a binary that works fine.

My best guess is that there is a hardware problem, but currently I'm just
collecting samples in case any patterns become clear.

I had a first look at it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiFeisFLKhY
