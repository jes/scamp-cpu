\section{Overview}

This document is a reference of the functions available in the SLANG library modules.

\section{Libraries}

\input{library-functions.tex}

\section{Blobs}

\subsection{Overview}

Most of the source code in a typical small program is library functions. To save
wasting time recompiling the library functions every time the program is
compiled, the library
functions are built in ``blobs'' which can be directly included in the output binaries.

Note that blobs are only used when compiling on SCAMP itself. When cross-compiling, all
included library code is re-compiled for every program that uses it.

\subsection{List of blobs}

\subsubsection{Default}

The default blob includes the following libraries:

\input{blobs.tex}

Other libraries will be re-compiled every time they are used.

\subsubsection{\texttt{bigint}}

Compiling with \texttt{-lbigint} will use the \texttt{bigint} blob, which
contains the default libraries, plus \texttt{bigint.sl}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{fixed}}

Compiling with \texttt{-lfixed} will use the \texttt{fixed} blob, which
contains the default libraries, plus \texttt{fixed.sl}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{bigfix}}

Compiling with \texttt{-lbigfix} will use the \texttt{bigfix} blob, which
contains the default libraries, plus both \texttt{bigint.sl} and \texttt{fixed.sl}.
