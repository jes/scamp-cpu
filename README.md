# SCAMP CPU

SCAMP is my homebrew 16-bit CPU. It stands for something like "Simple Computing and Arithmetic Microcoded Processor".

The CPU is very primitive. It doesn't support interrupts, and has no MMU, and no concept of privilege levels. It currently runs
at 1 MHz, above that the CompactFlash interface falls over. It runs a homebrew operating system, with a homebrew
programming language and compiler, and can self-host the kernel and all of the system utilities.
The environment tastes a bit like an early Unix, but works like CP/M. I used the computer to complete
almost all of [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).

My Advent of Code solutions are here: https://github.com/jes/aoc2021

I have some blog posts here: https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/tags/cpu.html and a web-based emulator available here: https://incoherency.co.uk/scamp/

Here are some pictures:

And here's a video with some explanation and an example session on real hardware:

## Architecture

It is a 16-bit CPU. The bus is 16-bit, registers are 16-bit, addresses are 16-bit, and memory contents are
16-bit. The upper 8 bits of an instruction select the opcode, and the lower 8 bits are available
for small immediate values. There is no support for: cache, interrupts, virtual memory, DMA, privilege rings,
floating point, and ~anything else that is not strictly necessary.

Here is a diagram of the architecture:

For more information, see [doc/UCODE.md](doc/UCODE.md) and [doc/ISA.md](doc/ISA.md).

## Try it out

The easiest way to try it out is to use the web-based emulator at https://incoherency.co.uk/scamp/

If you want to run it locally, first you'll need to build everything. Try `make -j` in the root directory of this
repository. It probably won't work on the first attempt because it works with multiple different Makefiles that have
annoying dependencies. Just run `make -j` twice or three times. If that doesn't do the trick, run `make` in `sys/` first, and then run
it in `.`. Once you get to the point that it is only complaining about `emcc`, you're done, unless you also
want to build the web-based emulator.

Having built everything, you can go into `kernel/` and start it in the emulator with `./run`:

    ~/scamp-cpu/kernel $ ./run
    make: 'os.disk' is up to date.
    SCAMP boot...
    .......................................................OK
    starting kernel...
    loading init...
          ____   ____    _    __  __ ____   __
         / ___| / ___|  / \  |  \/  |  _ \ / /__  ___
         \___ \| |     / _ \ | |\/| | |_) / / _ \/ __|
          ___) | |___ / ___ \| |  | |  __/ / (_) \__ \
         |____/ \____/_/   \_\_|  |_|_| /_/ \___/|___/

    $

If you know how to use Unix you'll probably understand how to use it. If you know how to use CP/M you'll probably
understand how it works.

If you want, you can write SLANG programs using `kilo` and compile them with `slc`. You've probably never written
SLANG before. You can learn how to use it by reading programs under `/src` (or `sys/` in the repo). It's mostly
like C but with fewer features and less safety.

## How it's made

I did these tasks, but working on several steps at a time (i.e. I didn't wait until after I had built the entire
computer before thinking about microcode or the operating system):

1. Create the CPU in Verilog, with a testbench for each part.
2. Replace the raw Verilog with Verilog that only uses 74xx-compatible primitives
   (e.g. https://github.com/TimRudy/ice-chips-verilog), but still passes the testbenches.
3. Convert the 74xx-Verilog into KiCad schematics (by hand).
4. Order the PCBs and components, solder up the PCBs, build a card cage, build a wooden case.
5. Settle on the instruction set and write the microcode (see [doc/table.html](doc/table.html), available online at https://incoherency.co.uk/interest/table.html).
5. Write a bootloader, kernel, shell, text editor, compiler, and various system utilities.

## Next steps

I suspect the computer will never be "finished", but some things I still want to work on are:

#### Hardware

 - [ ] build a hardware multiplication card (and maybe division?)
 - [ ] build a hardware RNG

#### Low-level software

 - [ ] make library blob self-hosting (compile within SCAMP/os)
 - [ ] write an strace-like debugging tool
 - [ ] write a DDT-like debugging tool
 - [ ] better facility for memory profiling (mainly to stop kilo and asm from running out of memory on large inputs)
 - [ ] atexit()
 - [ ] static initialisation of globals from constants (e.g. `var x = 5` at global scope should not take any code to initialise)
 - [ ] "const" variables (e.g. `const x = 5` should lead to `x` being replaced with the constant value `5` where possible)

#### Other software

 - [ ] write a big-fixed-point arithmetic library
 - [ ] fixed-point mathematics: pow,tan,asin,acos,atan,atan2
 - [ ] write a FORTH implementation (should it run on bare metal or under SCAMP/os?)
 - [ ] write a Z-machine interpreter and port some text adventures
 - [ ] write some games (pong? breakout? tetris?)
 - [ ] serial protocol: make it use xmodem-style block transfer for speed & error-checking

If you happen to want to work on any of the above, I'd be happy to help you!

Ben Eater's [videos on 8-bit CPU design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU) are excellent and heavily influenced
the design of my CPU.

I found the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOech0kWpH8-njQpmSNGSiQBPUvl8v3IM) for Nicolas Laurent's [compiler class](https://norswap.com/compilers/) quite helpful
in writing the parser for the compiler.
